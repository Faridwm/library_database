# Insight
What I learned about creating this database, 
one of them is to use the store procedure to store information on more than one table, 
using triggers for book inventory updates at the time the book is borrowed or returned. 
Using the Database event feature to automatically check the time of refund or member validity of a MySQL server in an online state, 
and use functions to create custom unique ID's.
